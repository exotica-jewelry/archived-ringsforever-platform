//
// Drupal's sticky headers on views tables
//

// Drupal sets the values of these sticky headers with JS once they reach the
// top of the screen. In order to override these injected styles, we have to
// use !important. It's also worth noting that there's a slight lag between
// when the top of the table reaches the bottom of the navigation bar and when
// it actually reaches the top of the screen and the sticky header kicks in.

.sticky-header {
  top: $header-height-sm !important;
}
