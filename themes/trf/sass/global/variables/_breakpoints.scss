// Sass Media Query Breakpoints
//
// Overrides defaults in sass-mq (via bower). Also see Omega settings for
// breakpoints in trf.info
//

// To enable support for browsers that do not support @media queries,
// (IE <= 8, Firefox <= 3, Opera <= 9) set $mq-responsive to false
// Create a separate stylesheet served exclusively to these browsers,
// meaning @media queries will be rasterized, relying on the cascade itself
$mq-responsive: true;

// Name your breakpoints in a way that creates a ubiquitous language
// across team members. It will improve communication between
// stakeholders, designers, developers, and testers.
$mq-breakpoints: (
  tinyish: 375px,
  smallish: 740px,
  mediumish: 980px,
  largeish: 1300px,
  hugeish: 3456px

  // Tweakpoints
  // desktopAd: 810px,
  // mobileLandscape: 480px
);

// Define the breakpoint from the $mq-breakpoints list that should
// be used as the target width when outputting a static stylesheet
// (i.e. when $mq-responsive is set to 'false').
$mq-static-breakpoint: largeish;

// If you want to display the currently active breakpoint in the top
// right corner of your site during development, add the breakpoints
// to this list, ordered by width, e.g. (mobile, tablet, desktop).
// $mq-show-breakpoints: (mobile, mobileLandscape, tablet, desktop, wide);
