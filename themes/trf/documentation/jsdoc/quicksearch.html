"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Classes carttooltips Externals jQuery.fn The Titanium Rings Forever themeTRF is a custom Drupal theme. Basic development instructionsTRF is compiled from Sass into CSS using gulp. We use gulp-sass, which uses node-sass, which runs on libsass. First, you will need to install Node.js and Gulp; ample documentation exists online to guide you. To compile the Sass into updated CSS, from the command line, cd into the theme directory and run npm install and bower install to fetch all dependencies. Then, run gulp to start watching and compiling. The default gulp task will update documentation as necessary, as well as minify images and scripts, and auto-prefix CSS rulesets. Version controlTRF's entire codebase is version-controlled with git, hosted in a public GitHub account. Do not change anything without committing it to git; even if it's a temporary or emergency fix, making one 5-second git commit will make it easier to track, change, or undo in the future. Because to date Exotica has had just one web developer, we go ahead and commit compiled CSS and minified JavaScript to the repository. Should we have multiple developers working together in the future, this approach could be revised. Developer documentationPlease review these sets of documentation before beginning development. Please use comments in the Sass and JavaScript files, consistent with the documentation syntax, when adding new code. Documentation is critical to keeping this theme maintainable. Please do not plan to &quot;do it later&quot;. Do it now, as you write your code. Style Guide (KSS)Documents the assorted designs, components, styles and markup patterns defined by the TRF site. You'll probably want to start here. Generated automatically using the default gulp task using comments in the Sass files. SassDocDocuments Sass breakpoints, functions and mixins, which are not included in a style guide. Generated automatically using the default gulp task using comments in the Sass files. JSDocDocuments custom JavaScript on the TRF site. Coding standardsTRF includes an .editorconfig file; you should install the appropriate plugin for your text editor if necessary and these standards will be enforced automatically: Indentation: 2 spaces, no tabs Insert final new line: yes Additional standards for all files in the theme: 80-character wide lines, with the exception of URLs or other strings that can't be broken across lines. These standards are specifically designed to align with the Drupal coding standards. Standards for writing Sass filesA Sass Lint file is included in the theme to enforce the following standards. Sass Lint has integrations for many text editors and IDEs. For class names, use SMACSS principles and BEM syntax, with styles broken into componentized Sass partials. Note this often means altering default Drupal templates or views to insert the appropriate class names. Write in SCSS format (&quot;CSS-style&quot;), not Sass format. Write rule sets across multiple lines, not all on a single line. Insert a space between a property's colon and its value. Insert a blank line between rule sets. Comment heavily. Adhere to the KSS syntax for documenting styles automatically on builds, and SassDoc syntax for documenting breakpoints, functions and mixins. Follow the Sass Inception Rule: Never nest more than four levels deep (and usually only one or two). Strings such as URLs and font-families should be wrapped in 'single quotes'. Numbers should be written with a preceding 0 if less than 1, e.g. 0.5, for readability. The number 0 should never have units (such as px or em). Mathematical operations in Sass should be wrapped in percentages for readability, e.g. padding: (2 * $padding); In general, color rules should be referencing a Sass variable; if a color that does not have a Sass variable is being written in directly you should have a very good reason (not laziness). When using multivalue rules, use a comma followed by a space, e.g. color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); Many other conventions are followed from Hugo Giraudel's Sass Guidelines; when in doubt, follow the guideline there. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on June 16, 2017 using the DocStrap template.
