Place patches that must be local and applied to the build here. In most cases,
patches to Drupal core or modules should be contributed back into the issue
queue. Some patches, however, are specific to our own site (for instance,
.htaccess redirects) and thus must be local.

Local patches in the `project.make` file are relative to that file.
